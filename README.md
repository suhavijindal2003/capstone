AI Enterprise Workflow Capstone Project 

## Master Template including the necessary inputs
Details to the master files could be found under: 
* [Capstone source: ](https://github.com/aavail/ai-workflow-capstone)

## Solution

Notebooks created and run with Anaconda on Mac with Python 3
Each Notebook creates the necessary logic in own python runtime files

The project setup is based on the file structure given in project-setup.py. This setup will create a runtime directory where all outputfiles (logs, models, data, images, unittest, dockerenv) are placed during runtime.
